I got an A for the final grade with this code. If you wish to contact me directly, send an email to hwang.mingi7@gmail.com, or send a friend request to goonmandu#4897 on Discord.

All code was compiled and tested to run under macOS 12.3 Monterey, with the Apple M1 (AArch64) SoC running Apple Clang. I cannot guarantee that the code will compile under Linux/Windows, with x86_64 processors, or when done so with GCC.
