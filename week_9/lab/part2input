If in life, you always show up, and get a
ticket every day, at some point you'll hit the juice.
Even if you show up and you don't get it
a hundred times in a row, maybe some day you'll
get it. But if you have no names in the
hat, how can you expect to be drawn from the
hat? You can't. Every day you gotta put your name
in it. At some point it goes juicer mode. You
just gotta believe. Gotta believe yourself in what you do.
